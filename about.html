      <h3>redfish Principles:</h3>
      <p>"You can rely on us to be consistent. We are not driven by chasing clicks or trends — we are journalists who strive to be objective about where things stand. But we don’t claim to be neutral: our team has a proven track record of both supporting and covering struggles which challenge the exploitative global system that enslaves humankind and is destroying our planet. We are in favour of people taking charge of their own destinies, against military and economic wars for profit and against racism. We believe in equality for all – regardless of gender, sexuality, range of abilities, age and religion. These are the principles that have set us on a journey to tell and investigate stories that challenge mainstream narratives." </p>

			<h3> <b> Vaush </b> </h3>
      <img src="images/vaush2.png" width="29%">
      <img src="images/vaush1.png" width="51%">

      <p> Vaush is an American left-wing YouTuber known for his advocacy for libertarian market socialism and debates with other youtubers, most notably Sargon Of Akkad and Destiny. Vaush holds left-wing views and identifies as a libertarian market socialist. However, he has said he doesn't care for the label that is put onto him and identifies more like a leftist in general. In spite of this, he despises authoritarian leftism, in fact having heavily fought against people espousing political positions similar to that of Mao Zedong and Joseph Stalin in the past, who he refers to as Tankies. </p>
