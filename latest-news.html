	<p>Clashes as hundreds of 'Kill the Bill' activists march on Bristol over plans to give police more powers to tackle non-violent protests... while officers in Newcastle pin woman to ground at demo in wake of Sarah Everard.</p>
	<li>Large protest has taken place today in Bristol against controversial Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. </li>
	<li>Bill will give police more power to impose conditions on non-violent protests, including for being 'too noisy'. </li>
	<li>Bill passed its second reading earlier this week, despite public opposition and votes against by Labour MPs.  </li>
	<li>Reclaim the Streets - who are protesting in wake of Sarah Everard's death - have also marched in Newcastle.  </li>
	<li>Last night, police arrested dozens of people as they attempted to break-up anti-lockdown protest in London. </li>
	<li>Protests are currently banned under lockdown legislation, which prevents large gatherings from taking place.  </li>

	<h2>EU export ban would delay UK Covid vaccine drive by two months</h2>
	<img src="images/covidvaccine4.png" width="50%">
	<p>Britain’s Covid vaccine programme faces a two-month delay in the event of an EU export ban, derailing the government’s plans to reopen the economy this summer, an analysis for the Guardian reveals. A ban, due to be debated by leaders of the 27 EU member states on Thursday, would badly stall the UK vaccination effort, and would be likely to force the government to extend restrictions on people’s lives.

  <p>A 'significant' number of cyber attacks targeting vulnerable Microsoft Exchange servers are attempted every single day, warn researchers at F-Secure - who say it's critical to apply the patches immediately. There are still thousands of cyber attacks targeting zero-day security vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server every single day as cyber criminals attempt to target organisations which have yet to apply the security patches released to mitigate them, according to a tech security company.

  <h2>Blasts of intergalactic radiation hint at elusive mid-sized black hole</h2>
  <img src="images/blackhole2.png" width="50%">
  <p>Powerful blasts of radiation from distant galaxies have revealed signs of an elusive medium-sized black hole, which may be a link between the small black holes that we have observed and the supermassive black holes that sit at the centres of galaxies. These medium-sized objects are notoriously hard to find because they don’t shine brightly like supermassive black holes and are too big for current gravitational-wave detectors to spot.
