<h2>GLOBAL THREAT: Kim Jong-un preparing to launch sub nuke missile capable of striking ANYWHERE in the world, satellite images suggest </h2>
<img src="images/nuke.png">
<p>KIM Jong-un is ready to launch a submarine capable of striking anywhere in the world with nuclear missiles, satellite images suggest. Fresh pictures of North Korea's Sinpho South Shipyard indicate that the floating drydock has recently been repositioned alongside the construction hall's submarine launch quay.</p>
<p>According to analysis by experts from the think-tank Stimson Center, posted on 38north, it suggests the new ballistic missile submarine - which has been under construction for several years - may "be nearing completion or is ready to be rolled out and launched in the near future". The piece adds: "Alternatively, the drydock may be there for rail alignment adjustment with those on the quay, as no submarine is known to have been launched from this location as of yet."

	<p>Spain has warned British tourists and second-home owners that they are not entitled to spend more than 90 days in the country at a time post-Brexit, but dismissed reports that offenders would be rounded up and deported if they overstay. Rules applying across the EU – which now apply to Britons – limit visa-free visits to those from outside the bloc to six months with an additional restriction of a maximum 90-day stay per 180-day period.

	<h2>Myanmar military leaders hold lavish party hours after 114 killed in deadliest day</h2>
	<img src="images/myanmar.png" width="50%">
	<p>Myanmar’s junta leader and his generals threw a lavish party hours after 114 people were killed in the deadliest day since the military coup.
