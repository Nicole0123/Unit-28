  <p>What is Fake News? Fake News is the presentation of false or misleading information presented as news. The aim of fake news is to damage the reputation of a person or an entity whilst profiting off of their lies. Fake News comes in all types of media, News, Written, Printed, Electronic, and Digital Communication. One prominant example of how fake news spreads would be looking at Donald Trump and Facebook.<p>
    <p>Ever since Trump came into office in 2016, his supporters have been spreading a conspiracy theory called Qanon. In summary, this theory believes that Trump is a God being sent to stop the Democratic pedophile and save all children. In reality, its a far-right, neo-nazi, white supremacist group who've been brainwashed by their social media, mainly Facebook, and the national news. Which unpredictably lead to the storming of the Capitol on Janurary 6th.</p>

    <h2> How To Spot Fake News </h2>
    <p> <b>Check Publisher's Credibility -</b> Check if the publisher site meets citation standards. Just because the website is popular and aligns with somebody's personal opinion over other sources, it doesn't mean that it's a credible source. </p>
    <p> <b>Check Domain Name - </b> False Domain Names are used to trick people onto their websites by copying another popular website such as, <b>"Facebook.com.co."</b> Usually these websites steal personal information off of users but sometimes they're used to create false articles and spread misinformation.</p>
    <p><b>Check Publications Point of View -</b> This is important because most mainstream news publications have a right political leaning, which results in misinformation, a public divide, and little to no repercussions for their actions. If this is the case, the information can be fact checked by doing personal research to get a clear understanding of the reported topic.</p>
    <p><b>Quality, Sources & Citations -</b> Look out for the quality for the writing such as, spelling errors, dramatic punctuation <b>(!!),</b>and if its told in first or third person. Double check their references to see if quoted material is a credible source. Check if the images used in the article are reversable during search because the image can be taken out of context or faked. Check to see if the same information is avaliable on other websites and most importantly, read beyond the headline for context.</p>
    <p><b>Recycled Material -</b> Check to see if an older news story hasn't been reposted and taken out of context.</p>


    <h2> Cover-up & Censorship </h2>
    <p>What is Censoriship? Censorship is the suppression of speech, public communication, or other information. This may be done on the basis that such material is considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, or "inconvenient." Censorship can be conducted by governments, private institutions, and other controlling bodies.</p>
    <p>Covering up information on the other hand can range from not reporting anything at all in the media, to manipulating a story so it fits a different narrative, other than the truth. An awefully common example of this is when the police sabotage evidence, and manipulate a case so it suits their narrative that they want out to the public, other than the truth. Censorship can also take another form, such as Preformative actions, pretending to do something for a good reputation and nothing more. Last example would be how the UK government has failed to support University students throughout the pandemic, despite students speaking up many times.</p>

      <p>For many university students, paying £9,000-a-year tuition fees doesn’t seem fair when you’re stuck inside halls and can’t attend any lectures.</p>

	<p>Jacinda Ardern has said New Zealand and “the world” need to return to some semblance of normality before she opens the country’s borders to foreign nationals. The prime minister shut the border in mid-March and said on Tuesday she would not open it again until New Zealanders were “vaccinated and protected” – a process that will not start for the general population until the middle of this year.</p>

	<p>Protesters defying a curfew in the Netherlands have clashed with riot police in a third night of unrest. More than 180 people were arrested on Monday in several cities.

	<p>A surge in threats against lawmakers and the US Capitol have forced National Guard troops to remain in Washington ahead of former President Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial. The troops will remain on Capitol Hill as the US Senate trial begins on 8 February, marking the first time in American history in which a former president has faced an impeachment trial after leaving office.</p>
